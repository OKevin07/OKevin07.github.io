        <P>I was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala. I relocated to Miami, FL as an infant. I graduated Highschool in 2009, earned my A.A in Business Administration in 2013.  
            I then relocated to Orlando FL to attend Universal Technical Institute, graduated with 3.5 GPA and earned my certificate of completion.
            After living in Orlando for 3 years I drove cross country to begin a new chapter in my life living in Portland OR.</P>
